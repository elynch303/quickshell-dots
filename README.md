## Install / Remove

Install and start the bar for the current session:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANCORE-linux/quickshell-dots/main/install.sh | bash -s V1
```

Install and keep the bar after reboot:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANCORE-linux/quickshell-dots/main/install.sh | bash -s V1 --autostart
```

Remove the bar and restore your previous config:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANCORE-linux/quickshell-dots/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

The installer backs up an existing config to `~/.config/quickshell/bar.bak.<timestamp>`.

On an interactive install without an existing Rise login hook, Omarchy Quattro
asks whether to enable Rise at login and hide the stock bar after Rise has been
verified healthy. For scripted installs, choose explicitly with `--autostart` or
`--no-autostart`; without a TTY or either flag, Rise starts for the current
session and leaves the persistent stock-bar state unchanged (normally visible).

### Manual Start / Restart

After installation, the bar lives at `~/.config/quickshell/bar` and can be run as the named Quickshell config `bar`.

Start it manually:

```bash
qs -n -d -c bar
```

Terminal-safe background start if you want to close the launching terminal immediately:

```bash
qs -n -d -c bar >/dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

If your interactive shell still keeps it in the job table, run:

```bash
disown
```

Stop or restart it:

```bash
qs kill -c bar
qs -n -d -c bar
```

Read the named config's current log:

```bash
qs log -c bar
```

Run the checked-out repo directly for development:

```bash
qs -p ~/Projects/Quickshell-Dots/versions/V1/shell.qml
```

## Requirements

Built for **Omarchy / Hyprland**. It integrates with `omarchy-*` helpers, Omarchy theme files, Hyprland, mako, and Omarchy's hook system.

Required packages are checked by the installer:

```bash
sudo pacman -S quickshell git jq curl coreutils util-linux procps-ng ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd ttf-material-symbols-variable
```

<details>
<summary>Optional widget dependencies</summary>

Optional packages enable specific widgets:

```bash
sudo pacman -S wireplumber libpulse pamixer brightnessctl upower power-profiles-daemon bluez-utils iwd impala hypridle gpu-screen-recorder
```

Notes:

- `bluez-utils` provides `bluetoothctl`, which the Bluetooth widget currently uses.
- `wireplumber` provides `wpctl`; `libpulse` provides `pactl` for the audio panel.
- `voxtype` is optional for the Voxtype widget.
- The install script checks required tools and warns about missing optional tools.

</details>

## Compatibility

Rise supports three transition paths without changing its QML layout:

- **Omarchy Quattro:** the Quattro shell keeps running for notifications,
  launcher, OSD, and other services. With Rise autostart enabled, only its stock
  bar surface is hidden after Rise passes a bounded registry health check.
- **Omarchy 3.8.x / Waybar:** the existing Waybar path remains active. Waybar is
  stopped only after Rise is healthy and is restored by the uninstaller.
- **Other Hyprland systems:** Rise still installs and starts normally. Omarchy
  hooks and theme integration are optional; configure login autostart through
  your desktop's normal session mechanism.

<details>
<summary>Omarchy Quattro stock-bar controls</summary>

The command direction follows Omarchy's persistent `bar-off` toggle and is easy
to misread:

```bash
omarchy toggle bar on   # hide the Quattro stock bar
omarchy toggle bar off  # show the Quattro stock bar again
```

The installer owns this state only when it hid a previously visible stock bar.
That ownership is recorded under
`~/.local/state/quickshell-rise/owns-omarchy-bar-off`; uninstall and
`--no-autostart` restore the stock bar only when that marker exists. A stock bar
already hidden by the user or another tool remains user-owned and unchanged.

Recovery never requires a keybind: open a terminal or TTY and run
`omarchy toggle bar off`. A normal `omarchy restart shell` leaves a regular
`qs -c bar` Rise process running. The rare Quickshell crash-relaunch form can run
as a bare `quickshell` process and may be stopped by that Omarchy restart; showing
the stock bar is the recovery path for this documented edge case.

</details>

## Usage

Most interactions follow one rule: click a widget to open its panel.

Common actions:

- Double-click an empty bar area to unlock drag/drop mode.
- Press `Esc` or click the dimmed backdrop to lock again.
- Open the launcher/control widget to change bar style, widgets, workspaces, logo, splits, and animations.
- Use the self-update badge when it appears to update the shell from inside the bar.

<details>
<summary>Theme / wallpaper keybinds</summary>

Omarchy binds theme and wallpaper menus to these keys by default:

| Action | Key | Omarchy default |
|---|---|---|
| Theme | `Super` + `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Space` | `omarchy-menu theme` |
| Wallpaper | `Super` + `Ctrl` + `Space` | `omarchy-menu background` |

To route those keys to this bar's pickers, add this to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf`:

```conf
unbind = SUPER SHIFT CTRL, SPACE
unbind = SUPER CTRL, SPACE
bindd  = SUPER SHIFT CTRL, SPACE, Theme picker,     exec, qs -c bar ipc call picker theme
bindd  = SUPER CTRL, SPACE,       Wallpaper picker, exec, qs -c bar ipc call picker wallpaper
```

Then run:

```bash
hyprctl reload
```

Other picker IPC commands:

```bash
qs -c bar ipc call picker screenshots
qs -c bar ipc call picker videos
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual autostart hook</summary>

If you did not install with `--autostart`, add the Omarchy post-boot hook manually.
On Quattro it starts and verifies Rise before hiding the stock bar:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/hooks/post-boot.d
curl -fsSL -o ~/.config/omarchy/hooks/post-boot.d/quickshell-rise \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANCORE-linux/quickshell-dots/main/contrib/post-boot.d/quickshell-rise
chmod +x ~/.config/omarchy/hooks/post-boot.d/quickshell-rise
```

Remove the hook safely. The conditional block returns only a stock-bar state
owned by Rise; it does not override a bar the user had already hidden:

```bash
marker=~/.local/state/quickshell-rise/owns-omarchy-bar-off
if [[ -f $marker || -f $marker.pending ]]; then
  omarchy toggle bar off && rm -f "$marker" "$marker.pending"
fi
rm -f ~/.config/omarchy/hooks/post-boot.d/quickshell-rise
```

</details>

## Updates

The bar checks for shell updates and shows an update badge when this repo has a newer version.

<details>
<summary>Shell updates and Arch/AUR safety checks</summary>

Click the shell update badge to review changes and apply the update.

Package updates run through the ArchUpdater panel. It checks packages against the known-infected AUR list and blocks known-bad packages from the update command.

## Repo Structure

<details>
<summary>Project layout</summary>
